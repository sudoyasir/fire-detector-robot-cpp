# 🔥 Fire Fighting Robot v2.2

A simple Arduino-based **Fire Fighting Robot** that can automatically detect fire, extinguish it using a water pump, and detect gas leaks.
This version **does not use GSM**, making it easy for beginners to build with only basic components.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. **Fire Detection**

   * The flame sensor detects fire.
   * When fire is detected, the buzzer starts ringing.

2. **Movement Control**

   * IR sensors help the robot avoid obstacles and move forward.
   * If an obstacle is in front, the robot stops and checks for fire.
   * If left or right sensors detect a path, the robot turns accordingly.

3. **Fire Extinguishing**

   * When fire is detected ahead, the robot stops.
   * The pump turns ON and sprays water.
   * The servo sweeps the nozzle left ↔ right to spread water.
   * Fire is declared extinguished and the robot resumes normal operation.

4. **Gas Detection**

   * If the gas sensor detects leakage, a warning is printed in Serial Monitor.

## 💻 Software Setup

1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Connect Arduino UNO/Nano via USB.
3. Copy the code (`FireFightingRobot.ino`) into Arduino IDE.
4. Select correct **Board** (Arduino UNO/Nano) and **Port**.
5. Upload the code.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Place robot on ground with free movement area.
2. Power ON the robot (motors + Arduino).
3. Open **Serial Monitor** (115200 baud) for debugging messages.
4. The robot will:

   * Move forward by default.
   * Stop and extinguish if fire is detected.
   * Sound buzzer on fire detection.
   * Print "Gas Detected!" if gas sensor triggers.
